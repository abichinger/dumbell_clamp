**A customizable clamp to secure your weights on your dumbell or barbell.**

Choose between **25mm, 30mm, 50mm** or open up the Customizer and set a **custom diameter** with `Bar_Diameter`.
The grooves allow you to add **rubber bands** for optimal grip. If the clamp is too loose, you can add more rubber bands or increase the `Compression` parameter.

Required bolts (`Height` parameter set to 33mm):
- 2x M3x30mm
- 2x M3x8mm
- 1x M3x18mm
- 5x M3 hex nut

If you prefer to use pins, you can set the parameter `Hinge_Type` to `Pin`.

**Disclaimer**: I only printed the clamp with a diameter of 25mm. I hope the other versions work as well.
